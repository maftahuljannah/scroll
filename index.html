        <p>The skin is the largest organ in the body, covering its entire external surface. The skin has 3 layers—the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, which have different anatomical structures and functions (see Image. Cross Section, Layers of the Skin)Helps keep your body at the right temperature. Prevents dehydration by keeping fluids inside the body. Gives you a sense of touch, allowing you to sense texture, pressure, and temperature. Makes vitamin D to help keep bones strong.Healthy skin is smooth, with no breaks in the surface. It is warm (not hot or red) and neither dry and flaky nor moist and wrinkled.Healthy skin looks smooth and feels smooth. If you look closely in the mirror, you will notice a uniform layout of your pores and tiny peaks around your hair follicles (yes, our face does have a fine layer of hair, almost invisible to the naked eye). The pores are small, tight, and feel smooth to touch.As you know by now, skin quality is dependent on the amount and condition of the three components hyaluronic acid, elastin and collagen. These components are found below the skin surface (which consists of dead, flattened skin cells) and to improve their function you might need to go deeper, below the skin surface.</p>
